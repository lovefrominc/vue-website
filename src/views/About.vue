    <h2 class="welcome">Welcome to LoveFrom Inc.</h2>
    <p>I am
    Sir. Jonathan Paul "Jony" Ive, a British industrial, product and architectural designer, the former Chief Design Officer (CDO) of Apple Inc., and the serving Chancellor of the Royal College of Art in London.
    </p>
    <p>And now, the CEO of LoveFrom Inc.</p>

    <h2 class="welcome">Story Behind LoveFrom Inc.</h2>
    <p>
      LoveFrom? Sort of an odd name on first hearing, right?<br/>
      Well, there’s a story there. The name comes from this Steve Jobs quote.<br/>
      There was an employee meeting a number of years ago and Steve was talking… He said "one of the fundamental motivations was that when you make something with love and with care, even though you probably will never meet… the people that you’re making it for, and you’ll never shake their hand, by making something with care, you are expressing your gratitude to humanity, to the species.”
      <br/><br/>                
      I identified with that motivation and was moved by his description. So my new company is called LoveFrom. It succinctly speaks to why I do what I do.”
